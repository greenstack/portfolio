# Movement Patterns
These classes manage entities in a bullet hell prototype developed my in first
semster at grad school. The object of these classes was to manage the way they
moved in a more generic way. Through these Movement Pattern objects, the team I
worked with was able to create more entities and generate new movement methods
without having to create a new entity class for each type of enemy or movement.
This also allowed us to create new and unique behaviors based on the movement
types.

I was responsible for the base Movement Pattern class in `MovementPattern.cs`.
All samples included here were primarily developed by me.
