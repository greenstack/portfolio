# Joseph Newman's  Code Portfolio
This repository contains code that I've worked on over time. Because many of
these samples have come from projects that I've worked on with other people,
not every line of code in a sample may be mine. When this is the case, I have
made mention of that in the sample's `README`; that said, the files I've
included are those where I've written more than 95% of the code.


# Directory Structure
The samples in this repository are sorted first by language, then by
framework/engine, if applicable. For example, all Unreal Engine code that I've
developed is in [C++/UnrealEngine](c++/UnrealEngine). If the framework or
engine isn't critical to the code sample, then I've included that in the base
folder for that language. For example, my `Vector2` C++ sample doesn't rely on
any particular framework, so it's found in [C++/Vector2](c++/Vector2).

Each directory with a sample in it contains a `README.md` that describes the
sample's purpose, when I developed it, and some of the problems I attempted to
solve with that code.
