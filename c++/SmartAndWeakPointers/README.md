# Smart and Weak Pointers
As a part of my master's-level Game Engineering I course while earning my
master's in entertainment arts and engineering at the University of Utah, I had
the opportunity to develop smart and week pointers in C++. Here, I did my best
to involve move semantics and ensure const-correctness where appropriate.

The unit tests here were also included as a part of the assignment to ensure
that the functionality of both my Smart and Weak pointers was correct. I did my
best to cover a variety of cases.

This code was developed during the Spring semester in 2020.
